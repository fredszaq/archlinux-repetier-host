archlinux-repetier-host
=======================

Arch Linux PKGBUILD for Repetier Host 3D printing software, with internal Slic3r working

This PKGBUILD uses cpanm to install Slic3r dependencies, this deps are not shared on the system (only for the package).

This provides a quick and dirty way to try Repetier Host : a single package to build, a single one to uninstall / upgrade if needed
